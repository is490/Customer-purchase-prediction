# Customer-purchase-prediction
In this age of E-Commerce, online shopping is a rather prevalent and common activity people indulge in. With the onset of COVID-19, online shopping rates shot up and up to 68% Indians increased their online shopping activity. However, when users shop online, it is not always that they end up purchasing the item in their cart. I, myself, have done this on countless occasions where I often add products in my shopping cart only to not purchase them later on. Considering this, it might be useful for companies and websites to know whether a particular customer is willing to finish their purchase or not and accordingly provide incentives which leads to a positive outcome. In this project, we try to predict a customer’s behaviour. We employ the use of classification algorithms to construct such a model. Additionally, in this project, we will apply machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forests and KNN to predict whether a customer will finish their purchase. The dataset used for the project is the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention dataset taken from UC Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository.
